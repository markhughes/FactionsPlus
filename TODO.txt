TODO:

- hook /f reload  to cause FactionsPlus to reload from disk too

- using "/f peaceful factiontag" from Factions will bypass the payment employed for "/f togglestate" 
  see if we're considering peaceful and togglestate the same thing, or they use different permissions ?
  ie. maybe only admins can use peaceful but any others can use togglestate (if different permissions are in effect)

- /f gc  is non-functional and /f fc
