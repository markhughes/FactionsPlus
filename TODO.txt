TODO:

- hook /f reload  to cause FactionsPlus to reload from disk too

- using "/f peaceful factiontag" from Factions will bypass the payment employed for "/f togglestate" 
  see if we're considering peaceful and togglestate the same thing, or they use different permissions ?
  ie. maybe only admins can use peaceful but any others can use togglestate (if different permissions are in effect)

//done - /f gc  is non-functional and /f fc

- maybe don't add /f gc and /f fc commands if Factions is 1.7 (easy to do but then the player might wonder why these 
commands aren't there, thus by allowing them to exist in 1.7 also they are showing the message that 1.7 actually doesn't
support chat modes)

- try compiling with jdk6 and see what needs to be reduced from being only jdk7 compatible (tho so far compiling with only jdk7 works fine on tests)
