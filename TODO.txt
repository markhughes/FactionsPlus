TODO:

- hook /f reload  to cause FactionsPlus to reload from disk too

- using "/f peaceful factiontag" from Factions will bypass the payment employed for "/f togglestate" 
  see if we're considering peaceful and togglestate the same thing, or they use different permissions ?
  ie. maybe only admins can use peaceful but any others can use togglestate (if different permissions are in effect)

- maybe don't add /f gc and /f fc commands if Factions is 1.7 (easy to do but then the player might wonder why these 
commands aren't there, thus by allowing them to exist in 1.7 also they are showing the message that 1.7 actually doesn't
support chat modes)
  Actually 1.7 can still do these commands but only if we tell the chats (which could be 3: EssentialsChat, HeroChat, CAPI)
  to switch channels somehow, seems tough... more info in this pkg(s): com.massivecraft.factions.integration.*

- must check what's /f toggle  supposed to do exactly, because the behaviour seems odd (also fix the possible NPE when faction inexistent)
  do this before release

- newest version tosses a 'Strange argument. Use the command like this: /f' whenever using any commands. Figure it has something to do with some changes
	made by basicsensei. I'll look into it tomorrow if it isn't fixed.
	//I can't see anything wrong because I cannot reproduce - basicsensei.

- look into setting permissions or groups of perms inside plugins.yml  with their description

- make bridging methods call-able from Utilities instead via Bridge.factions similar to existing ones like isLeader()
- make bridge for something like FPLayer.getRole()

- teleporting to /home could be bypassed if /home has a warmup and another command is executed right after but before
  teleport actually happens
  note to self: can be bypasses only if /home has a warmup delay, but not if it has a cooldown delay
