# FactionsPlus version 0.4.7

* added new config option Teleports.`disallowTeleportingToEnemyLandViaEnderPeals`
if set(to true) this will prevent ender pearl teleports that land in enemy territory
(you can still teleport outside of enemy land as long as ender pearl does land outside it)
  
* fixed /f gc and /f cf commands to not err on console
  they won't work for Factions 1.7 due to it counting on other plugins like HeroChat to provide faction/global chat
  (this might be fixed in the future so that you can use these commands in 1.7 too)

### config.yml features
* all subsequent (detected as)duplicate config options are automatically ignored and transformed into comments with
  a warning showing on console

# FactionsPlus version 0.4.6
* nothing specified here
