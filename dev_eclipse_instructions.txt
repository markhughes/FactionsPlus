======================================

To get FactionsPlus from github into your Eclipse workspace:
------
File->Import,  Git->Projects From Git, Next, URI, Next
fill in URI: with one of the following:
git://github.com/MarkehMe/FactionsPlus.git
https://github.com/MarkehMe/FactionsPlus.git
(for read-only access! if you're a dev with write access, log into github before you get the url from here:
 https://github.com/MarkehMe/FactionsPlus
)
Next, Next
Choose a location in your eclipse workspace under a folder named "FactionsPlus"
ie. Directory: C:\eclipse.workspace\FactionsPlus
or wherever else you want to store the git part
copy this path to clipboard ie. Ctrl+D Ctlr+A then Ctrl+C
click Next, after the cloning is done (requires internet connection *doh* ) then
open explorer or Winkey+E
select the address/location  or Alt+D
paste the previously copied path ie. Ctrl+V
press Enter to go into that folder, 
you're now in the folder where you cloned the project

now you have 2 options:
1. run eclipsify.bat file which does 2. automatically for you
OR
2. copy the folder .settings.eclipse  to .settings
   and the file .classpath.eclipse to .classpath
   (this will not work within explorer, at least in win7 due to it needing
    a name before the "." part)
note: if you're dev with write access to the repo then don't rename instead of 
copying because then you may accidentally commit these changes later: 
the deletion of the folder+file . 
 If you did 2. but renamed instead of copying then you'll need
to do Team->Reset, Local->master, select Hard (...working directory updated)
then click Reset button and answer Yes to lose local changes (assuming you 
didn't edit files yourself yet - workdir would be already changed because of the
rename you did)

you may close explorer, ie. Ctrl+W
then go back to the Cloning window in eclipse
Select Import existing projects
Next,
Finish

You now have the project but it likely has a red "!" on it, because of missing required .jar files
and the Factions project (which should be in your workspace), read below
======================================

In order to be able to compile this without errors in Eclipse, here's what you need:

------
A. jars needed (put them in the "lib" folder in the FactionsPlus project)
note: if "lib" doesn't exist just create it:
File->New->Folder
select FactionsPlus
type: lib
in the Folder name:
Finish

1. bukkit.jar
    get one from here:
    http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/bukkit/
    
    the jar name may vary so you might have to:
    left click FactionsPlus project then right click, choose Properties, 
    left click Java Build Path  then Libraries tab, click the "bukkit...jar" in list and Edit and 
    choose the downloaded file, click Open, then Ok

2. DisguiseCraft.jar
   get the top one from here:
   http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/disguisecraft/files/
   v2.5 tested
   
3. MobDisguise.jar
    get top one from here:
    http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/mobdisguise/files/
    MobDisguise 1.81 tested
    
4. Vault.jar
    get top one from here:
    http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/vault/files/
    Vault 1.2.16 tested
    
5. WorldGuard.jar
    get second one (the .zip )from here (and extract the jar from it):
    http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldguard/files/
    WorldGuard 5.5.2 tested
    
6. WorldEdit.jar
    get the top .zip from here(and extract the jar from it):
    http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/files/
    WorldEdit 5.3 tested

7. LWC.jar
   get the top one from here:
   http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/lwc/files/
   LWC 4.2.0 tested
   
8. At this point if you don't care about correctly following the sourcecode (ie. F3) you can get one of the 
Factions.jar files
instead of the Factions project, so choose one variant to follow below(using both will fail with correct sourcecode following 
ie. you end up at wrong lines in code upon F3 -ing in some Factions method)
choose one: (B. recommended)
    A) Factions.jar
        get any of 1.6 or 1.7 versions:
        http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/factions/files/
        -make sure the file name is Factions.jar  or modify the classpath yourself to point to it see step. 1
        -if you use this make sure you don't add both .jar or else you would never spot when you'll use a feature that
        exists in one version but doesn't in the other, ie. the field senderMustBeModerator exists in 1.6 but not in 1.7
        and using both jars would not err about this, and you cannot switch between the versions and spot this, unless ofc
        you'd remove the Factions 1.7 jar 

    B) the Factions eclipse project, the 1.6.x branch
       from: https://github.com/MassiveCraft/Factions
       -checkout this project in the same way that you checked out FactionsPlus project (aka this project)
       -and make sure that you compile it with jre6 just as FactionsPlus is (unless you use jre7 for running bukkit server
        then you can use jre7 for both projects, but u won't be able to run bukkit with jre6 without minor major version 
        errors which effectively disables FactionsPlus from loading, see below)
       -getting this from github would allow you to switch between the master (which is 1.7) 
        and the 1.6.x branches, just in case you want to see code differences when F3-ing around
        
Note: F3 key in Eclipse does: Open Declaration  (of the text that's under the cursor ie. a method name)
      
After you put all the files in the lib folder don't forget to F5 aka refresh, in
eclipse on the project or the lib folder, else eclipse won't see them.
If you have all these, the FactionsPlus project should compile without errors.
======================================


To actually export the .jar file  which would be named FactionsPlus.jar
This is the manual(unrecommended) cumbersome method(skip below for the epic method):
------
Legend:
[ ] means deselected
[v] means selected
(*) radio button selected

left click the FactionsPlus project 
then right click on it or Alt+F  to open File menu
choose Export, Java->Jar file, Next, 
Expand FactionPlus, 
make sure only "src" folder is selected
click FactionsPlus
make sure only the following files are selected:
config_defaults.yml
plugin.yml

now go below and ensure the options look like so:
[v] Export generated class files and resources
[ ] Export all output folders for checked projects
[v] (Optional)Export Java source files and resources(if you want to include sourcecode *.java files)
[ ] Export refactorings for checked projects.

Jar file: x:\XXX\FactionsPlus.jar
    where x:\XXX\ is your location like c:\dumps\

Options:
[v] Compress the contents of the JAR file
[v] Add directory entries
[v] Overwrite existing files without warning (Optional, up to you: it will not ask you if destination .jar exists already)

Next,
[ ] Export class files with compile errors
[v] Export class files with compile warnings

Next,
(*) Generate the manifest file
[ ] Save the manifest in the workspace

(*) Seal the JAR  (irrelevant)

leave empty at Main class:
Finish
--------------

This is how to export the .jar the "right" way:
double click the "fpexport_release_template.jardesc"  file from within Eclipse
you shouldn't have to modify anything there, all the settings are right and if you just click Finish
it would create Factions.jar file inside the built.jar (folder which resides in the project)

If you wanna go advanced, you can have build.jar folder symlink to the right folder you want the .jar to be exported into
ie. go into shell and into the FactionsPlus folder then:
    make sure built.jar folder doesn't exist (ie. rmdir built.jar)
    mklink /d built.jar c:\craftbukkitserver\plugins\
    and every time you export now, the FactionsPlus.jar will be auto placed in the plugins of your running test server
    (this tested on Windows 7, on *nix would be similar, but on windows you likely need to have NTFS file system which you normally would anyway)

If you do want to modify the settings and keep them but only for you, then you can, go Next and tick the
"Save the description of this JAR in the workspace" but do not change the file name for it (because it's in .gitignore )
and this way, next time you will only have to double click your personalized file "fpexport_personalized.jardesc" when
you want to export, and everytime you change something inside it now it will be auto saved


================

Caveats:
---1
Note: If you're getting these errors in bukkit:

[SEVERE] Could not load 'plugins\FactionsPlus.jar' in folder 'plugins'
org.bukkit.plugin.InvalidPluginException: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError
: markehme/factionsplus/FactionsPlus : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0

Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: markehme/factionsplus/Faction
sPlus : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0

It just means, that your server is running in jvm with a lower version that the compiled FactionsPlus.jar  
ie. your server running on jre6 and your jar was compiled with jre7 (well compiler compliance level 1.7 to be more exact)

Fix:
1. either run the server in jre7
2. or recompile FactionsPlus.jar with jre6 (which automatically means it'll use 1.6 ccl)

(we should have the project set to ccl 1.6 at the time of this writing, so you shouldn't have to worry about this)
---

---2
Do not use both Factions jars  which are v 1.6 and v1.7 or you won't spot fields/methods that actually don't exist in one
of the versions like the field senderMustBeModerator of FCommand class which means when running inside bukkit with the 
Factions version that didn't have the field, it will stack dump err on console
btw, senderMustBeModerator doesn't exist (well it's renamed) in Factions 1.7.x
java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: senderMustBeModerator

to fix: just use the Factions project in Eclipse, without having any Factions .jar files added to FactionsPlus classpath
you can switch between branches at will:  in Factions  1.6.x branch  and master (aka 1.7 branch)

================

Note to devs:
1. always keep .project file in the repository
2. never add .settings folder(or files within) or the .classpath file to the repository
This would ensure that devs working on this won't accidentally overwrite eclipse project stuff on commit and affect each 
other 
------
To make sure we don't get errors due to Factions 1.6 vs 1.7
when you're ready to make the FactionsPlus.jar , first switch between 1.6 and 1.7 (jars or branches of the Factions proj)
to check if FactionsPlus doesn't give errors on compile
 An example when this would happen, is when using senderMustBeModerator of FCommand and using Factions 1.6 jar or the 
1.6.x branch of Factions project, the FactionsPlus will compile just fine, but when you switch to 1.7 it will error, that
field doesn't exist in 1.7 (it's actually renamed).
 So this can go unnoticed and only actually fail on bukkit if they are using the 1.7 version of Factions
