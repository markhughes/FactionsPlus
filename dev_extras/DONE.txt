stuff that was previously in TODO but it is now done, so they are moved here,
for historical reasons and to perhaps prevent someone from attempting to do the same thing, if it was already done
this is also to keep out the clutter within the TODO file


//done - try compiling with jdk6 and see what needs to be reduced from being only jdk7 compatible (tho so far compiling with only jdk7 works fine on tests)

//done - look into how Factions is preventing commands to be executed while in enemy territory, to perhaps use that strategy to trap
  only certain commands like /home  rather than what we currently use: PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent
  //checked: it's using the same Event but with a LOW priority so they are trapped before the MONITOR event

//done- fix lwc to remove also wooden/iron/trapdoor when claiming land

//done - using disallowTeleportingToEnemyLandViaHomeCommand will attempt to prevent /home to be used to teleport into enemy land
        this can be bypassed if essentials if it has warmup on teleports, but the new flag below may help with finding out if 
        someone did bypass by showing a message on console when teleport was into enemy land and done by a command  

//done - reportSuccessfulByCommandTeleportsIntoEnemyLand config flag when true will report on console the player and command
        used to teleport into enemy faction (and which faction was it) this will aid in detecting if someone bypassed /home
        checks
        this flag is independent, ie. doesn't need disallowTeleportingToEnemyLandViaHomeCommand to be true
        
        if any of disallowTeleportingToEnemyLandViaHomeCommand or reportSuccessfulByCommandTeleportsIntoEnemyLand are set
        then the teleport hooks will be enabled, if both are false then the hooks won't be in.
        
//done - - fix deny LWC locks to actually hook in, by creating LWC module (can't otherwise) currently doesn't hook in ie:
        [SEVERE] Wrong method arguments used for event type registered
        
//done - makes sure you cannot use the same alias for 2 different config options (they are defined inside the java code)
       
//fixed by graceful disable on thrown exceptions- investigate why it sometimes says onDisable that LWCBase NoClassDefFoundError
 
 
//done - auto indent comments for the believe level, in config.yml

//done: recalculateLineNumbers - WYSection method to recalculate all line numbers based on current subtree

//done first part- add metadata to WYItem or WYIdentifier to be able to mark as duplicate/invalid/overridden, so that later we can read
  this and apply those after we've inserted the new/missing lines, and after having called the WYSection.recalcLines()

//done- check all current occurrences of config options so that they are not used without the "._" ie. used the instance instead of the
  value
